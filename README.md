# What Is RainbowPlus?
RainbowPlus is a simple and easy-to-use Overhead System. Unlike many others,
RainbowPlus comes with a unique feature- if someone buys a GamePass or the developer
puts their username in the settings folder, a smooth rainbow effect is added to their username!

# How Much Does it Cost?
You may not believe me, but it is entirely free!

# Why Did I Make This?
So others can add a unique feature to their ROBLOX game that not many games have.
This is mainly used for ROBLOX groups, but you can use it for whatever you want!

# Okay, So How Do I Get This?

# How Do I Set It Up?
Insert the file into your ROBLOX Workspace, and follow my instructions.
1. Copy your ROBLOX Group ID into the part that says "local groupID = 1"
2. Put your GamePass in the part that says "local gamePassId = 1"
3. And for whoever you want to get the Rainbow effect for free, put their username in the part that says "local Owners = {""}"

Thanks for using my product, and goodbye for now! (I will try to update this as much as possible)
